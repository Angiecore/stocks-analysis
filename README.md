# Overview of Project

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to refactor a VBA code in order to increase its performance and efficiency. The collected data is about stock market information from 2017 and 2018. This code analyzes twelve kinds of ticker, date the ticker was issued, the volume and the opening and closing price.  

## Results

Stock analysis outputs for 2017 and 2018. Challenge code:

Stock analysis outputs for 2017 and 2018. Refactored code:

As we can see for 2017 the analysis improved 0.46875 seconds with the refactored code, and for 2018 the improvement is 0.453125 seconds. We can conclude the refactored code is more efficient than the challenge code. 

## Summary

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Refactoring Code 

Refactoring is a great tool to improve and optimize a code. One of the benefits is that we can make a code cleaner and make it more maintainable in the process. However, refactoring also has disadvantages. For example, it could take a lot of time to understand and redo the original code design.

### Advantages and Disadvantages of the Original and Refactored VBA Script 

The advantage of refactor the “All Stocks Analysis” code was the we reduce the running time, and since the refactored code has written steps to set the structure for the refactoring code will be easier to read for other people that work on your code. A disadvantage of the original code the time of running. It was slower than the refactored code.
